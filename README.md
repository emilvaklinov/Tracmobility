- New Apple sign up button added. This is requirement when Facebook Login SDK is in use.
- Apple payment added
- Map and Geo location added
- Gmail sign up active
- Facebook sign up active.-
- Detailed user view done with implemented Apple pay button.
- Auth0 added. Aouth 2 is part of the Gmail, Facebook and Apple SDK.
- There is 2 seconds delay animation of the loading screen for netter visability of the logo.
- Using native signup methods but there si start up implementation of Firebase as second option.

PS. Apple sign up needs to be completed by implementing Key into the Apple Developers account! For now is just connected to the Map view.
For me is not clear what is the perpos of the name and e-mail fields here. This is not comon approach for Mob Apps it's mainly for websites and there is specific usage. By UI/UX point of view it is not user friendly as well.
